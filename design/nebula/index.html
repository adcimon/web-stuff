			<p>A <a class="nebula-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula">nebula</a> is a distinct body of <span class="nebula-bold">interstellar clouds</span> which can consist of cosmic dust, hydrogen, helium, molecular clouds; possibly as ionized gases. Originally, the term was used to describe any diffused astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way.</p>

			<p>There are a variety of formation mechanisms for the different types of nebulae. Some nebulae form from gas that is already in the interstellar medium while others are produced by stars. Examples of the former case are giant molecular clouds, the coldest, densest phase of interstellar gas, which can form by the cooling and condensation of more diffuse gas. Examples of the latter case are planetary nebulae formed from material shed by a star in late stages of its stellar evolution.</p>
