					is a distinct body of <span class="nebula-bold">interstellar clouds</span> which can consist of
					cosmic dust, hydrogen, helium, molecular clouds; possibly as ionized gases. Originally, the term was
					used to describe any diffused astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way.

						There are a variety of formation mechanisms for the different types of nebulae. Some nebulae
						form from gas that is already in the interstellar medium while others are produced by stars.
						Examples of the former case are giant molecular clouds, the coldest, densest phase of
						interstellar gas, which can form by the cooling and condensation of more diffuse gas. Examples
						of the latter case are planetary nebulae formed from material shed by a star in late stages of
						its stellar evolution.

						Other nebulae form as the result of supernova explosions; the death throes of massive,
						short-lived stars. The materials thrown off from the supernova explosion are then ionized by the
						energy and the compact object that its core produces. One of the best examples of this is the
						Crab Nebula, in Taurus. The supernova event was recorded in the year 1054 and is labeled SN
						1054. The compact object that was created after the explosion lies in the center of the Crab
						Nebula and its core is now a neutron star.
